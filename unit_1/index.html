<div id="generalinfo">
  <p>Atelier Creative is a space for children and parents all at one address.  Children are given the freedom and the resources to explore the creative arts, with or without instruction.  Parents can relax or participate, but either way, enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a fulfilled child.  Atelier is not a school, nor a daycare, but a community.</p>
